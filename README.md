# Twilight-Lands 1.01
Text based RPG with color graphics written in C++. Written for CSCI 1300 at CU Boulder Fall 2019. Code can be a bit messy due to time limitations.

Welcome to Twilight Lands, an RPG loosely based on DnD. There are 4 unique classes, each other which has their own special traits. Make sure to kill monsters for XP and coins,
which may be spent at shops. Make sure to level up before you take on the final boss!

Note, do not type in words when the game asks for a number input. This will break the game, sorry!
